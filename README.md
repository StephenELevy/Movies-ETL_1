# Movies-ETL

## This challenge is being submitted LATE!
##
##

## I have an iMac and I began the Rice Bootcamp program using
## the Mac operating system to read the modules, build
## scripts, and undertake the challenges.

## Part of the Module 8 ETL challenge required the use
## of pgAdmin to write the movie_df dataframe and ratings.csv
## files to the "movie_data" database. I spent 2 days unsuccessfully 
## trying to get pgAdmin to work on my iMac.

## I have a partitioned disk on my iMac, which also has the
## Windows 10 operating system. I had to set up set up the
## RiceBootcamp PythonData environment and other dependencies
## on the Window 10 operating system. The entire process of
## trying to get pgAdmin to work on my iMac and then moving
## moving my work environment to Windows 10 took over 2 days,
## which was lost time that should have been used to complete
## Challenge 8. I was able to load pgAdmin using the Windows
## operating system. Since then, I have been working my
## bootcamp assignments on Windows 10.


## At that point, I had to begin reading module 9 and 
## working that challenge. 

## This is the reason that I am so late submitting challenge 8.

## The files in my "Movies-ETL" GitHub repository consist of the
## scripts for the 4 challenge deliverables. I also included the
## "Movielens_Extract" script, which I built as part of the exercise
## for module 8. 


## The resource folder contains the movies_metadata.csv and wikipedia.json
## input files and the 2 .png files from the pgAdmin queries. Note that the
## ratings.csv file is NOT included in the Resource folder because that 
## file is too big to push to GitHub.

## IF you need to run my scripts, then you may have to change the input
## directory. You will also need a copy of the ratings.csv file in order
## for the scripts to execute correctly.

## The row counts for the "movies" and "ratings" tables in the "movie_data"
## database are displayed on the right side of the screen captures.
## Please look again.

## Thank You! Stephen Levy
